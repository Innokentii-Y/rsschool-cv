### Briefly About Myself:

I started my way into the frontend completely by accident. In 2021, my friend from the university invited me to work with him, from that moment on I started to immerse myself in html and css from scratch. Worked in cms bitrix, used php and js. Thanks to this start, I was able to join a larger company. At the moment I work for a large company as a frontend developer.<br>
Now I plan to develop my practical and theoretical skills.
